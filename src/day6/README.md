#### 2. Test Suite Framework
- Parameterized test cases
- Test data management
- Parallel test execution
- Coverage analysis

#### 3. Reporting System
- HTML/XML test reports
- Performance metrics
- Trend analysis
- Failure diagnostics

#### 4. Configuration Management
- Hardware configuration profiles
- Test parameter management
- Environment setup automation
- Version control integration

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Complete project build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)

# Cross-compilation for RISC-V
mkdir build-riscv && cd build-riscv
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/riscv-toolchain.cmake
make -j$(nproc)

# Run complete test suite
make test

# Generate documentation
make docs

# Package for deployment
make package
```
